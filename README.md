# translink_decoder
Reverse engineered the magstripe tickets for use on Translink with [Qartis](https://github.com/qartis/translink) back in the day

It's been a while since these have been phased out, so I figure it's ok to publish it.

I was responsible for figuring out the crc format, qartis did most of the rest.
